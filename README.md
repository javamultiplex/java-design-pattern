# Java Design Pattern


1. Creational
   * Prototype - A fully initialized instance to be copied or cloned.
     Ex - Chess board.
   * Builder - Seperate object construction from its representation.
     Ex - Menu of any restaurant
   * Singleton - A class of which only a single instance can exist.
     Ex - President of country, Database connection, Logging
   * Factory method - Creates a factory of object types.
     Ex - Shape factory that generates different shapes.
2. Structural
   * Proxy - An object representing another object.
     Ex - Credit card, Debit card
   * Decorator - Add responsibilities to the object dynamically.
     Ex - Adding discount on order, Adding toppings on pizza, Java IO.
   * Facade - A single class that represent an entire subsystem.
     Ex - Event manager, Online booking order.
   * Adapter - Match interfaces of different class.
     Ex - Power adapter.
   * Flyweight - A fine grained instance used for efficient sharing.
     Ex - Public switched network, JDBC Connection pooling.
